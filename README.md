## Fuzzytags for Go

This is an extremely rough initial implementation of [fuzzytags](https://crates.io/crates/fuzzytags) in Go. While it seems to have self-consistent behaviors and previous Rust/Go projects using these Ristretto libraries have been interoperable, I don't yet know if that's actually true for a variety of reasons. Stay tuned.
